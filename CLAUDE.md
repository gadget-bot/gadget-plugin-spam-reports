# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`gadget-plugin-spam-reports` provides a standalone spam reporting workflow and emits optional reward events for engagement systems. It handles report intake, status tracking, and removal outcomes. On successful removal it identifies the first reporter and emits a `spam.report.resolved` event for optional consumption by `gadget-plugin-engagement-ledger`. It has no hard dependency on the scheduler or chat adapter plugins.

This plugin is part of the [Gadget](https://github.com/gadget-bot/gadget/) ecosystem — a Go Slack bot framework built on the Slack Events API.

See `docs/specs/gadget-plugin-spam-reports.md` for full v1 requirements.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
make build        # Compile binary to dist/
make test         # Run tests with coverage
make lint         # Run golangci-lint (also runs fmt check)
make fmt          # Check formatting with golangci-lint (diff only)
make all          # clean → verify → lint → test → build
make tools        # Install golangci-lint
make start-db     # Start local MariaDB container
make stop-db      # Stop local MariaDB container
make container    # Build Docker image as gadget-plugin-spam-reports:local
```

Run a single test:
```bash
go test -v -run TestFunctionName ./pkg/...
```

**Always prefer `make` targets over calling `go` commands directly.** Only fall back to raw `go` commands when no suitable make target exists (e.g., running a single test).

Run `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` after any code changes before committing.

## Architecture

<!-- TODO: document key packages, entry points, and data flow as the plugin grows. -->

## Testing

Tests use Go's table-driven testing pattern. Always use interfaces and dependency injection so handlers accept mock clients rather than creating their own. Never instantiate real API clients inside handlers.

## Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

**Breaking changes:** append `!` after type/scope, or add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer.

## Branching

- `main` — production releases only; NEVER commit directly to main
- Always create a feature branch and open a PR for all changes

## GitHub Repository

The origin repository is `gadget-bot/gadget-plugin-spam-reports`. Always use this owner/repo when querying GitHub for issues, pull requests, or other repository details.

## GitHub Issues

When opening issues:
- Always apply an issue type and the best-fitting label
- Scan existing issues to identify relationships (sub-issues, duplicates, related issues)
- Ask before changing existing relationships
